 ⚠️##Use Arror Functions##
1. Write a addBookFunction to handle with Add Book Form
2. Function should print all input value in console as submit form (click on add book button);

result example : 
{
    bookTitle : "Core JavaScript",
    bookAuthor : "mr. xyz",
    bookISBN : "abcde",
    bookPublisher: "xyz publication",
    bookPublicationDate: "01/01/2025",
    bookGenre : "sdfsdf",
    bookPages: 210,
    bookLanguage: "English",
    bookDescription: "this is core javascript book."
}

3. Use - e.preventDefault() - to stop html form basic behaviors

4. Try to create an Array of objects - (an array that holds many objects)

example : const bookList = [{}, {},{},{}...]

5. Try to store form date in localStorage();

👉📖#cheatsheet
const addBookFormHandler = ()=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    let bookTitleTag = document.getElementById("form-book-title);

    #object sample

    const book = {
        bookTitle = bookTitleTag.value;
    }

    console.log(book);


#for array of objects
    const bookList = [];
    bookList.push(book);
}

that's enough hint 😅
